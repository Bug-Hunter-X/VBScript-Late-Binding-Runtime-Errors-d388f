# VBScript Late Binding Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in VBScript caused by late binding and provides a solution with improved error handling.

## Problem

VBScript's flexibility with late binding can lead to runtime errors when dealing with objects that might not exist or lack expected members.  The provided `LateBindingError.vbs` demonstrates a scenario where an attempt to access a member of an object might fail.

## Solution

`LateBindingSolution.vbs` offers a robust approach to prevent such errors. It utilizes error handling to check for the existence of objects and members before accessing them.
